# malicious-theme-extension
This is an extension written for Firefox (though compatible with other browsers) that disguises itself as a theme changer, but really logs all websites you've visited and sends it to a localhost server and injecting "ads".

Privacy has always been a large concern of mine, and as such I'm careful to vet which extensions I install. This is not the case for everyone, and the point of this project is to show that something as inconspicious as a theme extension has the potential to be quite malicious, both in terms of privacy and advertisements.


This was made for the UNSW course COMP6841 (Security Engineering) as a project.
